# Fastify and Swagger Template

**Description:**

This is a basic template for projects using Fastify. It includes a basic configuration with Swagger to make it easier to document endpoints in a REST API and make route files easier to read. A small middleware configuration has also been set up for authentication using an API key in the endpoints.

**Variables:**

The basic variables used for the configuration are in a .env file. You must create this file before running the project.

**Running:**

To run the project, run the following command:

```CMD
npm run dev
```

**Updates:**

Small updates will be uploaded to this template every week. If you have any suggestions to make the template more scalable, please feel free to share them.
