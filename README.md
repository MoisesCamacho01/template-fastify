# Fastify and Swagger Template

## Description:

This is a basic template for projects using Fastify. It includes a basic configuration with Swagger to make it easier to document endpoints in a REST API and make route files easier to read. A small middleware configuration has also been set up for authentication using an API key in the endpoints.

## Variables:

The basic variables used for the configuration are in a .env-example file. You must create this file before running the project.

## Running:

To run the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Updates:

Small updates will be uploaded to this template every week. If you have any suggestions to make the template more scalable, please feel free to share them.

> [!NOTE]

>In the folder **Documentation** you will find the md files with the updates that I am making in the corresponding commits that I will upload.
